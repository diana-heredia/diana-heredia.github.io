I am a Ph.D candidate in the Department of History at the University of Texas at Austin. I was originally trained as a biologist in Mexico (B.Sc. Biology, UNAM) and have specialized in the history of science and colonialism since 2012. My current research uses dye cultivation and commerce as a lens to explore early modern Hispanic extractivism, knowledge production, and material culture.
