I'm a History Ph.D student at the University of Texas at Austin. My current
research focuses on the circulation of material culture and lay knowledge in
local communities from New Spain.
I have a B.Sc in Biology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico
(UNAM) and have specialized since 2012 in the history of science.
